If we are unable to confirm that You are the Relevant Age then we may suspend Your Account until such time that we are able to confirm that You are the Relevant Age.

Such monies may (subject to paragraph 5) then be used by You to place bets or play games. Further details of how to deposit, withdraw and transfer funds can be found in the Deposit part of the Help section of the Website. If You use a payment method in respect of which You are not the account holder, we reserve the right to treat any deposit into the Account as being invalid (and any winnings arising from such deposit as void) pending the satisfactory completion of all relevant Checks.<br/><br/>7.2 You further agree not to make any charge-backs, reversals or otherwise cancel any deposits into Your Account, and in any such event to refund and compensate us for such unpaid deposits including any expenses incurred by us in the process of collecting Your deposit.

Monies deposited by You to Your Account will be held in a bank account and/or escrow account which will be kept separate from our company funds. Monies in Your Account are not insured, guaranteed, sponsored or otherwise protected by any deposit or banking insurance system or by any other similar insurance system. As such, monies in Your Account are not protected in the event of insolvency. This meets the Gambling Commission's requirements for the segregation of customer funds at the level: basic segregation.<br/><br/>7.4 We may at any time set off any positive balance on Your Account against any amount owed by You (including under a Duplicate Account) to any other company within the Operator's Group (irrespective of whether there has been a breach of the Terms of Use), including (without limitation) where we re-settle any bets or wagers pursuant to paragraph 4.7(Duplicate Accounts), paragraph 11 (Collusion, Cheating, Fraud and Criminal Activity) or paragraph 18 (Errors or Omissions).<br/><br/>7.5 To the extent required by Your local law or tax or other authorities You are responsible for reporting Your winnings and losses arising from the Services.<br/><br/>7.6 You can set a deposit limit on Your Account in any one day. This limit cannot be increased without giving us twenty four hours' notice of Your wish to increase Your deposit limit and only when twenty four hours have elapsed from Your request for such an increase will the increase apply. For details of how to set up a deposit limit please contact Customer Services, or (where Your Account is for the Website) set up the limit through the Website by clicking on My Account, then Update Account Details. Any confirmed reductions to your deposit limit will be of immediate effect.<br/><br/>7.7 Subject to paragraph 12 (Closure of Your Account; etc), You may request withdrawal of funds from Your Account at any time provided that:<br/><br/>7.7.1 all payments made into Your Account have been confirmed as cleared and none have been charged-back, reversed or otherwise cancelled;<br/><br/>7.7.2 any Checks referred to in paragraph 5 (Verification of Your Identity; Money Laundering Requirements) above have been completed by us to our satisfaction; and<br/><br/>7.7.3 You have complied with any other relevant withdrawal conditions affecting Your Account (e.g. any applicable Bonus Terms).<br/><br/>7.8 On any withdrawal approved by us, provided that You give us sufficient information as to how the funds should be transferred to You, we will return the relevant funds to You in accordance with paragraph 7.7 (less charges incurred or any other amount required to be deducted from Your withdrawal in order to comply with any applicable law).<br/><br/>7.9 We will attempt to accommodate Your request regarding the payment method and currency of payment of Your withdrawal. This, however, cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, we may process and pay withdrawals in a different payment method than the one requested by You, such as through different payment providers, a bank draft or wire transfer (any charges associated with relevant payment methods are set out in the Withdrawal part of the Help section of the Website). Similarly, in certain cases, the currency of Your withdrawal may not be the currency in which Your deposit was made or that was otherwise requested by You and, in circumstances where we are required to convert Your deposits between different currencies, the conversion rate used by us is as stated in the Help section of the Website.<br/><br/>7.10 Inactive Account Fee. If You do not use Your Account for betting or gaming, making a deposit, withdrawal or transfer, or if it is otherwise inactive, for a period of at least 13 consecutive months then it will be an "Inactive Account". All Inactive Accounts will incur a fee("Inactive Account Fee"), the details of which can be found in the Help section of the Website. We will notify You when Your Account becomes an Inactive Account, and at least 14 days before any Inactive Account Fee is deducted from it.<br/><br/>8.

The fact that the Website is accessible in any such country, or appears in the official language of any such country shall not be construed as a representation or warranty with respect to the legality or otherwise of the access to and use of the Website, and the making of deposits or receipt of any winnings from Your Account. The availability of the Website does not constitute an offer, solicitation or invitation by us for the use of or subscription to betting, gaming or other services in any jurisdiction in which such activities are prohibited by law.<br/><br/>8.2 It is Your responsibility to determine the law that applies in the location in which You are present. You should ensure that You will be acting legally in Your jurisdiction in opening Your Account and/or using the Website and You represent, warrant and agree that You will do so.<br/><br/>8.3 If it becomes apparent to us that You are resident in a country in which the use of the Website is not legal, we shall be entitled immediately to close Your Account, in which case any balance on the Account on the date of such closure will be refunded to You as soon as it is practicable for us to do so.<br/><br/>9.

If You are in any doubt as to whether a Transaction has been accepted successfully, You should contact Customer Services.<br/><br/>9.5 Once a Transaction has been accepted by us, You cannot cancel the transaction unless we agree otherwise.

In the event of any such telephone disconnection, You should immediately contact our Customer Service team for confirmation as to whether your bet has been placed.<br/><br/>9.6 We may, at our discretion (and provided that neither You nor we gain any unfair advantage), elect to accept a bet notwithstanding that the relevant event has begun. In respect of gaming, the relevant Game Rules shall set out the point at which no further stakes will be accepted by us.<br/><br/>9.7 We may cancel or amend a Transaction pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 5 (Verification of Your Identity), paragraph 11 (Collusion, Cheating, Fraud and Criminal Activity) or paragraph 18 (Errors or Omissions).<br/><br/>10.
